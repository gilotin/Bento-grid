## My process

-   Understanding the task;
-   Separate it into smaller tasks (if possible), then solve them one by one.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   I'm really happy for finishing the challenge. I didn't have an experience with grid layout and it was difficult to create _grid-template-areas_ at first. I had to rebuild the project two times before the final product.
-   Better and faster working with keyboard only features of VSCode.
-   Still learning CSS, BEM and best principles of writing HTML.

### Continued development

-   I'm continuing my journey of becoming better frontend developer.
-   Need more practice with JS, CSS (grid and flex), and HTML (for SEO);
-   I have to optimize my CSS better.
